# Entity Browser

The [Entity Browser](https://drupal.org/project/entity_browser) module provides a very flexible and generic entity browsing and selecting tool. It can be used in any context where one needs to select any number of entities and do something with them.

Examples of few possible use cases:
- powerful entity reference widget,
- embedding entities into WYSIWYG,
- you name it!

Entity Browser comes with an example module (modules/example in main repo) which can be used as a starting point. It comes with some example configuration and shows how Entity Browser can be used as a field widget for Entity Reference fields.

If your need is to work only with images/files, you might want to check out also the module [File Entity Browser](https://drupal.org/project/file_browser), that uses Entity Browser to provide nice content creation experiences and re-usability of core files/images.

## Development 

We use Github pull request workflow. In order to contribute to the module please [create a pull request](https://github.com/drupal-media/entity_browser/compare) and cross-link it with the [relevant drupal.org issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/entity_browser).
